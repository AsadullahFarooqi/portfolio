Highly skilled and passionate. Taking full ownership and making an impact on the team is my goal. My direction is totally toward the vision and mission of the product otherwise giving a vision to the product. Working on technical projects/products and Solving technical problems every day. I have vast experience in a variety of tech stacks so The product vision and how to build it in the safest durable, and most friendly way is my top priority. Keeping an eye on the weak points, such as if it is a startup it has to stand on its feet ASAP rather than wasting on showing off. For a successful product, it has to maintain that success so no compromise on the selling brand/customer-loving matrix.

The Tech stack that I've worked with in the past years is Python, Golang, Django, Flask, Go-kit, Gin, Rust, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, React JS, Angular JS, GraphQL, MongoDB, Postgres, MySQL, Redis, and more.
